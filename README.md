# Lab10_all

This repository contains a Python implementation of a simple Genetic Programming (GP) algorithm for solving a symbolic regression problem. The goal is to find an expression that approximates a given target function using basic arithmetic operations.

## Problem Description

The target function we aim to approximate is: $f(x)=x^2+x+1$

The search space for candidate solutions consists of expressions built using the following basic arithmetic operations:

- Addition (`add`)
- Subtraction (`sub`)
- Multiplication (`mul`)

## Further Study

For a more comprehensive implementation of Genetic Programming, you can check out the [tiny_gp](https://github.com/moshesipper/tiny_gp) repository by Moshe Sipper. This repository provides a more complete GP algorithm, and you can learn more about GP techniques and best practices from the code provided in that repository.
